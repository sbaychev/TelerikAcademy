//Gergana loves dancing and she also likes bits (she doesn't know what bits really are, but she knows that she likes them). 
//Few days ago she accidently invented a new term - “dancing bits”.
//If you ask her what “dancing bits” mean she will tell you that it’s a sequence of identical bits (so the bits can dance 
//together – zeros can only dance with other zeros, the same applies for ones).
//You are given N positive integer numbers that are converted to binary numeral system and are concatenated together in one 
//big sequence of bits. 
//For example: if we have 4 numbers: 5 (101 in binary numeral system), 6 (110 in binary numeral system), 14 (1110 in binary 
//numeral system) and 143 (1000111 in binary numeral system) their concatenation will be 101110111010001111.
//You are also given a positive integer K - the number of identical bits (zeroes or ones that can dance together).
//Write a program that finds the number of all “dancing bits” (the sequences of equal bits) with a length of exactly K bits. 
//Your program should search in the concatenation of the given N numbers.
//For example, if we have 4 numbers (5, 6, 14 and 143, the concatenation of their binary representation is 
//101110111010001111) and we are searching for the total number of all sequences of equal bits with an exact length of 3 bits,
//the answer will be 3 (the sequences are bolded in the concatenation above).
//In this example we have two sequences of “dancing bits” - "111" consisting of only ones and one sequence of “dancing bits”
//- "000" consisting of only zeros. Note that the sequence "1111" is not a sequence of exact 3 identical bits.
//Input
//The input data should be read from the console.
//At the first input line there will be one positive integer – the number K.
//At the second input line there will be another positive integer – the number N.
//At each of the next N lines there will be one positive integer – the N numbers that represent the input sequence of bits.
//The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
//Output
//The output data should be printed on the console.
//The only output line must contain the answer – the number of “dancing bits” sequences found. 
//Constraints
//•	The number K will be positive integer number between 1 and 25 600, inclusive.
//•	The number N will be positive integer number between 1 and 800, inclusive.
//•	Each of the N numbers will be positive integer numbers between 1 and 2 147 483 647, inclusive.
