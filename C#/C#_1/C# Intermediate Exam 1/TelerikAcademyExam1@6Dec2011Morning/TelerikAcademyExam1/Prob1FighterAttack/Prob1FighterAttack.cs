{
    class Prob1FighterAttack
    {
//A rectangular plant P located in east-west direction is under attack by a fighter aircraft flying over it on the west. 
//When the fighter launches a missile we have its coordinates F. It is assumed that the missile's direction is always 
//straight on the west and the missile always hits the target after a fixed distance D in front of the fighter.
//To simplify our model we assume the land is built of square cells of size 1 x 1 located in east-west direction and each cell
//has integer Cartesian coordinates {x, y}. In this model the plant can be represented by a rectangular area of cell and the 
//missile always hits some of the square cells (inside or outside of the plant).
//When the missile hits a certain cell, the damage over it is 100%, on the cells staying on the left and on the right of it the
//damage is 50% and in front of it the damage is 75%. The total damage is sum of the separate damages and can exceed 100%.
//You are given the location of the plant P, the location of the fighter F and the distance D. Write a program that calculates
//the damage over the plant after the attack. Note that the missile could hits the plant partially of fully or can hit some
//area outside of the plant and cause no damage.
//At the figure below a plant P, a fighter F, a distance D and the missile hit point are shown along with the damage caused 
//over the cells by the hit. Note that some of the damaged cells are outside of the plant and thus the total damage is 225%:

//Your task is to write a program that calculates the total damage caused after the attack over the plant.
//Input
//The input data should be read from the console. There will be exactly 7 lines holding the integer numbers 
//PX1, PY1, PX2, PY2, FX, FY, and D. The plant P is given by the coordinates of any two of its opposite corners and is 
//non-empty (consists of at least one cell). The location of the fighter is given as cell coordinates FX, and FY and the 
//distance D is given as an integer number.
//The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
//Output
//The output should consist of a single line holding the total damage given as percentage.
//Constraints
//•	The numbers PX1, PY1, PX2, PY2, FX, FY, and D are all integers in the range [-100 000 … 100 000].
