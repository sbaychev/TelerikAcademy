//Christmas Eve is coming so even programmers have to prepare!
//In the spirit of the event your task is to write a program that prints a fir tree to the console.
//The format of the tree is shown in the examples bellow.
//Input
//The input data should be read from the console.
//On the only input line you have an integer number N, showing the height of the tree.
//The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
//Output
//The output data should be printed on the console.
//You must print the fir tree on the console. Each row contains only characters "." (point)  or "*" (asterisk).
//The first row should have exactly one "*" in the middle (that is the top of the tree) and each of the next lines two more.
//The last line should have exactly one asterisk in the middle, showing the stem of the tree.
//Constraints
//•	The number N is a positive integer between 4 and 100, inclusive.
