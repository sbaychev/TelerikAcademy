Always use ! var ! to declare a variable.

ECMA script is the standard for JavaScript, it is based on it.


Data wrappers in JavaScript:
Array
Number
Object
String
	We can simply put in the expected value, like string in the var and not put the Data Wrapper
	var num = 5; is the same as
		var num = Number(5);
We can parse variables via:		parseVARIABLETYPE
Every arithmetic operation in JavaScript returns a NUMBER

In variables there is variable hoisting
When we declare and initialize a variable we can use it only afte it, but if we do it seperate - > we can use it before it is even declared and initialized

functions can be used anywhere in the code, regardless of their initializzation place...


Operators in JavaScript:
	Unary - take one operand
	Binary - take two operands
	Ternary - ( ?: ) - takes three operands

All floating point numbers are double

Upon using Xor on Booleans, the return value is 1 or 0, not a True or False !!
String to Number comparison is equalized to number and comparison is made

 === Operator compares types !!

In JavaScript All data can be "upcast" to whatever is being passed, needed in the situation
